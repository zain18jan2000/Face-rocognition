Implementation of Face recognizer with OpenCV in Python<br/>

<h3>WHAT IS FACE RECOGNIZER ?</h3>
<p> A face Recognizer is a program or software used for identifying or verifying the identity of an individual by using their face. It is different from a face detection program because a face detector detects the face of a individual wheras a face recognizer can differentiate between two different faces. </p>
